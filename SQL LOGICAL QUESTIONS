1.	Question: Write a query to find the countries with the highest temperatures in the dataset? 
A.	SELECT Country, Temperature
    FROM country_pollution
    WHERE Temperature = (SELECT MAX(Temperature) FROM country_pollution);
2.	Question: Write a query to identify the countries with the lowest CO2 emissions in the dataset. 
A.	SELECT Country, CO2_Emissions
    FROM country_pollution
    WHERE CO2_Emissions = (SELECT MIN(CO2_Emissions) FROM country_pollution);
3.	Question: Write a query to find all temperature records above a specific value, for example, 20 degrees Celsius. 
A.	SELECT * FROM country_pollution
    WHERE Temperature < 20;
4.	Question: Write a query to list all countries with CO2 emissions data available for the year 2020. 
A.	SELECT Country, CO2_Emissions
    FROM country_pollution
    WHERE Date_Year = 2020;
5.	Question: Write a query to count the total number of temperature records in the dataset. 
A.	SELECT COUNT(Temperature) AS TotalTemperature
    FROM country_pollution;
6.	Question: Write a query to identify any countries with missing temperature data for a specific year, for example, 2015. 
A.	SELECT DISTINCT Country
    FROM country_pollution
    WHERE Date_Year = 2019
    AND Temperature IS NULL;
7.	Question: Write a query to find the average temperature for each year in the dataset. 
A.	SELECT Date_Year, AVG(Temperature) AS AverageTemperature
    FROM country_pollution
    GROUP BY Date_Year
    ORDER BY Date_Year;
8.	Question: Write a query to calculate the total CO2 emissions for all countries in the dataset. 
A.	SELECT SUM(CO2_Emissions) AS TotalCO2Emissions
    FROM country_pollution;
9.	Question: Write a query to sort the temperature data in descending order based on the temperature values. 
A.	SELECT * FROM country_pollution
    ORDER BY Temperature DESC;
